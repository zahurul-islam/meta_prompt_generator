Guidelines:
1. If certain information is not present in the email, use null for that field or omit the field entirely.
2. Preserve the exact text as it appears in the email.
3. Convert dates to ISO format where possible (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS).
4. For action items, extract all explicit requests or tasks mentioned in the email.
5. If you're uncertain about any information, include a "confidence" field with a value between 0 and 1.
6. Only include the JSON in your response, with no additional explanation or commentary.
7. Make sure to capture all recipients if there are multiple.
8. For the body text, exclude the greeting and signature that are separately captured.
