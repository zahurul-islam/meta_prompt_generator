Guidelines:
1. If certain information is not present in the document, use null for that field or omit the field entirely.
2. Extract key clauses as they appear in the document without interpretation.
3. For monetary values, convert to numbers and specify the currency.
4. Use consistent date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD).
5. If you're uncertain about any information, include a "confidence" field with a value between 0 and 1.
6. Only include the JSON in your response, with no additional explanation or commentary.
7. Pay special attention to defined terms in the document, which are often capitalized.
8. For obligations, focus on explicitly stated responsibilities rather than implied ones.
